    "We can have a for loop within a for loop. What does this mean and why do we need it? Think about how clocks keep time. Clocks have a seconds counter, a minutes counter and an hours counter. The seconds counter is the inner most loop: it goes through all (60) its iterations before the minutes and hours for loops count. It counts seconds from 1 to 60 while the minutes and hours counters do nothing. When it hits 60 seconds, the minutes counter goes up by +1 (and the seconds re-start from 1). These two cycles are repeated until the minutes go up to 60. Then the hours counter goes up by +1. By the time one hour has passed, the minutes counter has iterated 60 times and the seconds counter has iterated by 60x60 = 3600 times. \n",
