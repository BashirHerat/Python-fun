    "This is my effort to understand **object oriented programing** in Python. In OOP, we have classes and objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as a blueprint for a house. The house is the object that's made as per the blueprint. You can create many houses (objects) using the same class (blueprint). Blueprint has properties such as the layout, number of rooms and size of the house. Once the house is built, it inerites those properties but also has properties of its own such as address, owner and furniture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties are called <u>attributes</u>. When you define a class, you decide what its attributes are. All objects in that class inherit those attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about this: consider a class to be a mold, and objects are what's made using this mold. So the mold and the objects produced using it both have attributes such as width and length. The objects can have extra properties like their color, weight etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, the user usually defines the class and decides what its attributes should be. You can then define instances (i.e. objects) of the class. The objects will have the same attributes. We can then assign values to these attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we create a class called Person. We decide that this class should have attributes name, age and hobby. Now we create a specific person, called person_one, as an instance or object of this class and set its attributes to Jane, 30, golf. See? An object is an example/instance of the class where attributes take specific values. We can create another instance of this class, called person_two, and assign the values Jalil, 29, football for its attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has built-in classes such as list and dict. User defined classes can use attributes and methods from built in classes. In technical terms we say the user defined class inherits the built-in class's attributes & methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "OOP provides a way to structure code and create reusable components that can be used throughout an application or system. By organizing code into classes and objects, we can create a more flexible program structure, with better abstraction and encapsulation."
